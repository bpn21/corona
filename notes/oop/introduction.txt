oop

Emphasis on data rather than procedure
program is divided into objects while in c Large program was divided into smaller programs known as function.
An object is a complete entity.It has all the data and associated function with it.
Data is hidden and cannot be accessed bt external function while data were made globle in c.


An object is basic run-time entity in object orinted system.


CLASS :
class is the collection of object of similar type.(like mango,apple, orange are member of class fruit.) Once a class is created, any number of objects beloging to that class can be created.

ABSTRACTION:
act of representating essential features without including background details.


ENCAPSULATION:
wrapping of data and function into single unit (called class) is known as encaptulation.

INHERTITANCE : 
process in which object of one class can accure the properties of object of another class.

POLYMORPHISM :
polymarphism refers to ability to take more than one form.
function overloading and operator overloading shwo the concept of compile time polymorphism while run time polymorphism is run by using virtual function.


DISADVANTAGES OF OOP

COMPILE AND RUN TIME OVERHEAD IS HIGH.
REORINTATION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPER TO OBJECT ORIENTED THINKING.
REQUIRES MASTERLY IN SIFTWARE ENGINEERING AND PROGRAMMING METHODOLOGY.
BENEFITS ONLY IN LONG TERM WHILE MANAGING LARGE SOFTWARE PROJECTS.


operator overloading : 
c++ extends the meaning of operator for user defined types. such as +,-,+=,>,<,>>,<<, etc are designed to opereate on special data types. HOWEVER, through operator overloading features, we can extend the meaning of operators to operate on user defined types.
