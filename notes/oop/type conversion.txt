type conversion
when datatypes are mixed in an expresson. c++ converts datatypes automatically.
this process is called automtic data conversion.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
   int a, b;
  float c;
  cout<<"enter two numbers : "<<endl;
    cin>>a>>b;
    c = static_cast<float>(a)/b;
    cout<<"answer : "<<c<<endl;
    return 0;
}


here, both and b are integer, if a was float it would automatically convert into float. in order to convert forcefullly we need type casting
