we have a tool called angular cli

You use the Angular CLI to create projects, generate application and library code, and perform a variety of ongoing development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.
To install the Angular CLI, open a terminal window and run the following command:


npm install -g @angular/cli
Run the CLI command ng new and provide the name my-app, as shown here:

content_copy
ng new my-app
The ng new command prompts you for information about features to include in the initial app
The CLI creates a new workspace and a simple Welcome app, ready to run.
